/**
 * Floor Memory
 * The set APIs are used to develop Floor pds which can be used as their personal assistants.   This set of APIs are divided into two parts.  - Memory and  - Registration.   The developer has two ways of using the APIs for the app development. Developer can choose to the  Registration APIs for using the existing xfloor infracture or can implement custom Registration process. In the case of custom registration process, the developer is bound to provide proper authentication mechanisms and then send the user information to xlfoor.

     * Posts into the given floor_id. This is asynchronous ingestion. 200 OK means queued, not immediately retrievable. This API allows a user to **post personal content into their POD (Personal Object Database)**. The posted content is stored under a specified **floor**, embedded by the platform, and made available for **semantic querying, conversational retrieval, and memory-based interactions**.  It is primarily used to:  * Save reminders, notes, writeups, or personal knowledge * Upload content that the user wants the system to remember * Add information that should later be discoverable via conversational queries  The content may consist of **text only** or **text combined with one or more media files**.  ---  ## **Key Capabilities**  * Stores user-generated content inside a specific floor * Supports **multi-modal inputs** (text + media) * Automatically embeds content for semantic search * Makes content available to:    * `/agent/memory/query`   * conversational agents   * future recall and analytics * Associates content with user, block, and application context  ---  ## **Authentication**  * Requires a valid, authenticated `user_id` * The calling application is responsible for user authentication * `app_id` identifies the application context  ---  ## **Request Type**  **Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`  ---  ## **Request Parameters**  ### **1.

Embeddings are generated for:     * Text    * Supported media (where applicable) 5. The content becomes part of the user’s **personal memory store**. 6. The stored data is immediately available for querying and conversational retrieval.  ---  ## **Successful Response**  On success, the API confirms that:  * The content has been stored * Embeddings have been generated * The memory item is available for future queries  A success status and reference identifiers are returned.  ---  ## **Error Handling**  The API may return errors if:  * Required fields are missing (`floor_id`, `user_id`, `description`) * Unsupported file formats are uploaded * The user does not have access to the specified floor * The request payload is malformed * Internal embedding or storage operations fail  ---  ## **Typical Use Cases**  * Saving personal reminders * Posting notes or observations * Uploading documents for future reference * Creating a personal knowledge base * Feeding data into conversational agents  ---  ## **One-Line Summary**  > Stores user-generated text and media into a personal POD, embeds it for semantic search, and makes it available for conversational querying.  ⚠️ Content Ingestion is Asynchronous  The Create Event API queues content for processing.
