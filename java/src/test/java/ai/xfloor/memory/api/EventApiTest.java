/*
 * Floor Memory
 * The set APIs are used to develop Floor pds which can be used as their personal assistants.   This set of APIs are divided into two parts.  - Memory and  - Registration.   The developer has two ways of using the APIs for the app development. Developer can choose to the  Registration APIs for using the existing xfloor infracture or can implement custom Registration process. In the case of custom registration process, the developer is bound to provide proper authentication mechanisms and then send the user information to xlfoor.

    /**
     * Create Event (Post Content)
     *
     * ## Create Event (Content Ingestion)  Posts content into the specified &#x60;floor_id&#x60;. This API performs **asynchronous ingestion** — a &#x60;200 OK&#x60; response means the content has been **accepted and queued**, not immediately retrievable.  This API allows a user to **post personal content into their POD (Personal Object Database)**.  The posted content is stored under a specified **floor**, embedded by the platform, and made available for **semantic querying, conversational retrieval, and memory-based interactions** once processing completes.  It is primarily used to:  * Save reminders, notes, write-ups, or personal knowledge * Upload content the user wants the system to remember * Add information that should later be discoverable via conversational queries  The content may consist of **text only** or **text combined with one or more media files**.  ---  ## Key Capabilities  * Stores user-generated content inside a specific floor * Supports **multi-modal inputs** (text + media) * Automatically embeds content for semantic search * Makes content available to:    * &#x60;/agent/memory/query&#x60;   * conversational agents   * future recall and analytics * Associates content with **user**, **block**, and **application** context (when provided)  ---  ## Authentication  * Requires a valid, authenticated &#x60;user_id&#x60; * The calling application is responsible for user authentication * &#x60;app_id&#x60; identifies the application context  ---  ## Request Type  **Content-Type:** &#x60;multipart/form-data&#x60;  ---  ## Request Parameters  ### 1. Files (Optional)  | Field   | Type     | Required | Description                                                           | | ------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | | &#x60;files&#x60; | &#x60;file[]&#x60; | Optional | Media files to attach to the content. Multiple files may be uploaded. |  **Supported formats include (but are not limited to):**  * Images: &#x60;jpg&#x60;, &#x60;png&#x60; * Audio: &#x60;mp3&#x60; * Documents: &#x60;pdf&#x60; * Video: &#x60;mp4&#x60;  These files are processed and embedded along with the textual content where applicable.  ---  ### 2. Input Information (Required)  | Field        | Type            | Required | Description                                                       | | ------------ | --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | | &#x60;input_info&#x60; | &#x60;string (JSON)&#x60; | Yes      | JSON string containing metadata and textual content for the post. |  ---  ## &#x60;input_info&#x60; Structure  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;json {   \&quot;floor_id\&quot;: \&quot;my_floor\&quot;,   \&quot;block_id\&quot;: \&quot;17845683456\&quot;,   \&quot;block_type\&quot;: \&quot;1\&quot;,   \&quot;user_id\&quot;: \&quot;145623907625\&quot;,   \&quot;title\&quot;: \&quot;My note\&quot;,   \&quot;description\&quot;: \&quot;Things I should remember\&quot; } &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  ---  ## Field Descriptions  | Field         | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                               | | ------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | &#x60;floor_id&#x60;    | &#x60;string&#x60; | Yes      | Identifier of the user’s floor (POD) where the content will be stored.                                    | | &#x60;block_id&#x60;    | &#x60;string&#x60; | Optional | Identifier of the block within the floor used to group or categorize content.                             | | &#x60;block_type&#x60;  | &#x60;string&#x60; | Optional | Logical category of the content (e.g., &#x60;0 for post&#x60;, &#x60;1 for forum&#x60;). Used for routing and UI organization. | | &#x60;user_id&#x60;     | &#x60;string&#x60; | Yes      | Unique identifier of the user posting the content.                                                        | | &#x60;title&#x60;       | &#x60;string&#x60; | Optional | Short title or heading for the content.                                                                   | | &#x60;description&#x60; | &#x60;string&#x60; | Yes      | Main textual content to be stored and embedded.                                                           | | &#x60;app_id&#x60;      | &#x60;string&#x60; | Optional | Identifier of the calling application context.                                                            |  ---  ## Behavior  1. The API validates the user and floor context. 2. Textual content (&#x60;title&#x60; and &#x60;description&#x60;) is ingested. 3. Attached media files (if any) are processed and linked to the content. 4. Embeddings are generated for:     * text    * supported media (where applicable) 5. The content becomes part of the user’s **personal memory store (POD)**. 6. Once background processing completes, the content becomes available for:     * semantic search    * conversational retrieval    * memory-based interactions  ---  ## Successful Response  On success, the API confirms that:  * The content has been **accepted** * Processing has been **queued** * Reference identifiers are returned  &gt; A successful response indicates **acceptance**, not immediate availability.  ---  ## Error Handling  The API may return errors if:  * Required fields are missing (&#x60;floor_id&#x60;, &#x60;user_id&#x60;, &#x60;description&#x60;) * Uploaded files use unsupported formats * The user does not have access to the specified floor * The request payload is malformed * Internal embedding or storage operations fail  ---  ## Typical Use Cases  * Saving personal reminders * Posting notes or observations * Uploading documents for later recall * Building a personal knowledge base * Feeding content into conversational agents  ---  ## ⚠️ Asynchronous Ingestion Notice  Content ingestion is **asynchronous**.  A &#x60;200 OK&#x60; response means the request was **successfully queued**. Newly ingested content may take time to become searchable via the Query API.  Use **Recent Events** or retry queries after a short delay to confirm availability.  ---  ## One-Line Summary  &gt; Stores user-generated text and media into a personal POD, embeds it asynchronously, and makes it available for semantic and conversational querying.  If you want, next I can:  * align this **exactly** with the OpenAPI schema fields * generate **JS / TS / Python / Java snippets** using this definition * add **state diagrams** (queued → processing → searchable) for docs
