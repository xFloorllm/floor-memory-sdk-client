        # **Conversational Query API**
        This is the **core API** of xfloor.

        It accepts a natural language query and returns a conversational response
        derived from:
        - Content ingested into the specified Floor
        - The user’s prior conversation history (if provided)
        - Relevant metadata and context

        This API is designed for **multi-turn conversations** and can be used
        to build:
        - AI chatbots
        - Knowledge assistants
        - Floor-specific copilots

        This API enables **conversational, context-aware querying** over data stored within xfloor.

        It accepts a natural language query (for example, *“What options do I have in your institute?”*) and returns relevant information derived from the specified floors and their associated content.

        The API is designed for **multi-turn conversations**. Follow-up questions from the same user automatically build upon prior context, allowing the system to refine, expand, or clarify results across successive calls.

        ---

        ## **Core Capabilities**

        * Interprets **natural language queries**
        * Retrieves relevant information from one or more floors
        * Applies **time-, type-, and tag-based filters**
        * Supports **Top-K retrieval** for result control
        * Optionally includes metadata with responses
        * Can generate **summarized responses** when requested
        * Maintains **conversation continuity** across multiple queries from the same user

        ---

        ## **Authentication & Identity**

        * A valid `user_id` is **required**
        * User authentication is assumed to be completed **before** calling this API
        * `app_id` identifies the calling application context
        * Conversational continuity is maintained **per `user_id`**

        > **Note:** All queries from the same `user_id` are treated as part of a single conversational context unless explicitly reset by the application.

        ---

        ## **Request Contract**

        ### **HTTP Method**

        `POST`

        ### **Content-Type**

        ```
        application/json
        ```

        > **Important:**
        > This API accepts **JSON requests only**.
        > `multipart/form-data` is **not supported**.

        ---

        ## **Request Body (JSON)**

        ### **Field Descriptions**

        | Field               | Type                    | Required | Description                                                                                    |
        | ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | `user_id`           | string                  | Yes      | Unique xfloor user identifier. Used to maintain conversational continuity and personalization. |
        | `query`             | string                  | Yes      | Natural language query provided by the user.                                                   |
        | `floor_ids`         | array of strings        | Yes      | List of floor identifiers that define the search scope. Must be provided as a JSON array.      |
        | `filters`           | object                  | Optional | Additional constraints to narrow search results.                                               |
        | `filters.time_from` | string (ISO-8601)       | Optional | Start timestamp for filtering content by creation or update time.                              |
        | `filters.time_to`   | string (ISO-8601)       | Optional | End timestamp for filtering content by creation or update time.                                |
        | `filters.types`     | array of strings        | Optional | Content types to include (e.g., `post`, `blog`, `forum`).                                      |
        | `filters.tags`      | array of strings        | Optional | Tags used to further refine results.                                                           |
        | `k`                 | integer                 | Optional | Maximum number of results to retrieve (Top-K). Defaults to system-defined behavior if omitted. |
        | `include_metadata`  | string (`"0"` or `"1"`) | Optional | Whether to include metadata (source, timestamps, tags) in the response. Defaults to `"0"`.     |
        | `summary_needed`    | string (`"0"` or `"1"`) | Optional | Whether a summarized conversational answer should be generated. Defaults to `"0"`.             |
        | `app_id`            | string                  | Optional | Identifies the application invoking the API. Useful for multi-app integrations.                |

        ---

        ### **Important Encoding Rules**

        * `floor_ids` **must** be provided as a JSON array

          ```json
          "floor_ids": ["floor_1", "floor_2"]
          ```
        * Boolean-style flags (`include_metadata`, `summary_needed`) are encoded as **string values**: `"0"` or `"1"`
        * `filters` must be provided as a **JSON object**, not a string

        ---

        ### **Canonical Request Example**

        ```json
        {
          "user_id": "xf_user_123",
          "query": "What options do I have in your institute?",
          "floor_ids": ["institute_floor"],
          "filters": {
            "types": ["post", "blog"],
            "tags": ["admissions"]
          },
          "k": 5,
          "include_metadata": "1",
          "summary_needed": "1",
          "app_id": "student_portal"
        }
        ```

        ---

        ## **Behavior**

        1. The query is analyzed using conversational and semantic understanding.
        2. Relevant content is retrieved from the specified floors.
        3. Filters (time, type, tags) are applied if provided.
        4. Results are ranked and limited based on `k`.
        5. If `summary_needed = "1"`, a synthesized conversational summary is generated.
        6. If `include_metadata = "1"`, metadata is attached to each result item.
        7. The response is returned in a conversational format suitable for follow-up questions.

        ---

        ## **Response Contract**

        ### **High-Level Response Structure**

        ```json
        {
          "answer": "Assistant-generated conversational response",
          "items": [
            {
              "id": "content_id",
              "type": "post",
              "text": "Original content snippet",
              "metadata": { }
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        ---

        ### **Response Field Semantics**

        | Field              | Always Present     | Description                                 | Rendering Guidance     |
        | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
        | `answer`           | No                | Assistant-generated conversational response. Depends on summary_needed. Is present if summary_needed=1 | **Render prominently** |
        | `items`            | Yes (may be empty) | List of matched content used for grounding  | Render optionally      |
        | `items[].metadata` | Conditional        | Included only if `include_metadata = "1"`   | Render on demand       |

        > **No-Result Case:**
        > If no relevant content is found, `items` will be an empty array and `answer` will contain a conversational fallback response.

        ---

        ## **Conversation Continuity**

        * Conversation state is maintained **per `user_id`**
        * Follow-up queries automatically reference prior context
        * The API does not require explicit conversation IDs
        * Applications may reset conversation context by using a new `user_id`

        ---

        ## **Error Handling**

        The API may return errors in the following cases:

        * Missing or invalid `user_id`
        * Empty or unsupported `query`
        * Invalid or inaccessible `floor_ids`
        * Authorization or application context errors
        * Internal processing failures

        All errors are returned with appropriate HTTP status codes and descriptive messages.

        ---

        ## **Typical Use Case Flow**

        1. User asks an initial question
           *“What options do I have in your institute?”*
        2. Application calls `/agent/memory/query`
        3. Results are displayed to the user
        4. User asks a follow-up
           *“Which ones are available on weekends?”*
        5. Application calls the same API again with the new query
        6. Conversation continues seamlessly using prior context

            Primary response payload containing assistant output and retrieved content.

            This response represents the successful execution of a **conversational query** processed by the agent.

            The API performs:

            1. Interpretation of the user’s query
            2. Optional retrieval of relevant content (posts/events/blocks)
            3. Generation of a final **natural-language answer**

            The response contains **two logical parts**:

            * **`answer`** → the assistant’s final conversational response (what should be shown to the user)
            * **`items`** → the list of retrieved content items that were matched and used (or considered) during answer generation

            ---

            ## Response Structure

            ```json
            {
              "answer": "string",
              "items": [ ... ]

            | Field    | Type   | Description                                               |
            | -------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
            | `answer` | String | Final assistant-generated response to the user query      |
            | `items`  | Array  | List of matched content items retrieved during processing |

            ---

            ## `answer`

            ```json
            "answer": "non veniam reprehenderit labore"
            ```

            ### Description

            * This is the **final conversational output** generated by the agent.
            * It is intended to be **directly rendered** in the chat or UI.
            * The content may be:

              * A direct answer
              * A summary
              * A synthesized response based on retrieved items

            ---

            ## `items[]` – Retrieved Content Items

            Each entry in `items` represents a **content block or event** that matched the query.

            These items are typically used for:

            * Explainability (“why this answer?”)
            * Debugging or analytics
            * Showing sources or related content (optional UI)

            ---

            ### Item Object Structure

            ```json
            {
              "block_type": 25453249,
              "block_id": "96",
              "floor_uid": "87",
              "event_id": "59",
              "text": "Deficio cruentus voluptatem...",
              "score": -80399794.92417637,
              "block_title": "furthermore separately skeleton...",
              "block_details": "Duis magna dolore",
              "from_floor_uid": "73",
              "user_id": "32",
              "match_type": "culpa mollit"
            }
            ```

            ---

            ### Item Fields

            | Field            | Type   | Description                                                              |
            | ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
            | `block_type`     | Number | Identifier of the block type (e.g., feed, blog, forum, quiz)             |
            | `block_id`       | String | Unique identifier of the block containing the content                    |
            | `block_title`    | String | Title of the block                                                       |
            | `block_details`  | String | Description or metadata associated with the block                        |
            | `event_id`       | String | Identifier of the specific event/post within the block                   |
            | `floor_uid`      | String | Internal floor ID where the content belongs                              |
            | `from_floor_uid` | String | Source floor ID (used when content is derived, federated, or aggregated) |
            | `user_id`        | String | Identifier of the user who created the content                           |
            | `text`           | String | Content text used for matching or retrieval                              |
            | `score`          | Number | Similarity or relevance score assigned by the retrieval system           |
            | `match_type`     | String | Type or category of match (e.g., semantic, keyword, hybrid)              |

            ---

            ## Interpretation of `score`

            * Higher relevance is typically indicated by **better score ranking** (interpretation depends on backend logic)
            * Scores may be positive or negative depending on normalization and similarity model
            * Clients should **not rely on absolute score values**, only relative ordering

            ---

            ## Typical Usage Patterns

            ### Chat UI

            * Display only `answer`
            * Ignore `items` unless showing “Sources” or “Related content”

            ### Debug / Analytics

            * Inspect `items` to understand what content influenced the answer
            * Use `score`, `match_type`, and block metadata

            ### Explainable AI

            * Show selected `items` as citations or expandable references

            ---

            ## Notes for Developers

            * `items` may be an empty array if no relevant content was retrieved
            * The `answer` is always present on success
            * The order of `items` is typically sorted by relevance
            * Field values and score scales are implementation-specific and may evolve

            ---

            ## Minimal Mental Model

            > **Answer** = what the agent says
            > **Items** = what the agent looked at

        ## Create Event (Content Ingestion)

        Posts content into the specified `floor_id`.
        This API performs **asynchronous ingestion** — a `200 OK` response means the content has been **accepted and queued**, not immediately retrievable.

        This API allows a user to **post personal content into their POD (Personal Object Database)**.

        The posted content is stored under a specified **floor**, embedded by the platform, and made available for **semantic querying, conversational retrieval, and memory-based interactions** once processing completes.

        It is primarily used to:

        * Save reminders, notes, write-ups, or personal knowledge
        * Upload content the user wants the system to remember
        * Add information that should later be discoverable via conversational queries

        The content may consist of **text only** or **text combined with one or more media files**.

        ---

        ## Key Capabilities

        * Stores user-generated content inside a specific floor
        * Supports **multi-modal inputs** (text + media)
        * Automatically embeds content for semantic search
        * Makes content available to:

          * `/agent/memory/query`
          * conversational agents
          * future recall and analytics
        * Associates content with **user**, **block**, and **application** context (when provided)

        ---

        ## Authentication

        * Requires a valid, authenticated `user_id`
        * The calling application is responsible for user authentication
        * `app_id` identifies the application context

        ---

        ## Request Type

        **Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`

        ---

        ## Request Parameters

        ### 1. Files (Optional)

        | Field         | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                               |
        | ------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | `floor_id`    | `string` | Yes      | Identifier of the user’s floor (POD) where the content will be stored.                                    |
        | `block_id`    | `string` | Optional | Identifier of the block within the floor used to group or categorize content.                             |
        | `block_type`  | `string` | Optional | Logical category of the content (e.g., `0 for post`, `1 for forum`). Used for routing and UI organization. |
        | `user_id`     | `string` | Yes      | Unique identifier of the user posting the content.                                                        |
        | `title`       | `string` | Optional | Short title or heading for the content.                                                                   |
        | `description` | `string` | Yes      | Main textual content to be stored and embedded.                                                           |
        | `app_id`      | `string` | Optional | Identifier of the calling application context.                                                            |

        ---

        ## Behavior

        1. The API validates the user and floor context.
        2. Textual content (`title` and `description`) is ingested.
        3. Attached media files (if any) are processed and linked to the content.
        4. Embeddings are generated for:

           * text
           * supported media (where applicable)
        5. The content becomes part of the user’s **personal memory store (POD)**.
        6. Once background processing completes, the content becomes available for:

           * semantic search
           * conversational retrieval
           * memory-based interactions

        ---

        ## Successful Response

        On success, the API confirms that:

        * The content has been **accepted**
        * Processing has been **queued**
        * Reference identifiers are returned

        > A successful response indicates **acceptance**, not immediate availability.

        ---

        ## Error Handling

        The API may return errors if:

        * Required fields are missing (`floor_id`, `user_id`, `description`)
        * Uploaded files use unsupported formats
        * The user does not have access to the specified floor
        * The request payload is malformed
        * Internal embedding or storage operations fail

        ---

        ## Typical Use Cases

        * Saving personal reminders
        * Posting notes or observations
        * Uploading documents for later recall
        * Building a personal knowledge base
        * Feeding content into conversational agents

        ---

        ## ⚠️ Asynchronous Ingestion Notice

        Content ingestion is **asynchronous**.

        A `200 OK` response means the request was **successfully queued**.
        Newly ingested content may take time to become searchable via the Query API.

        Use **Recent Events** or retry queries after a short delay to confirm availability.

        ---

        ## One-Line Summary

        > Stores user-generated text and media into a personal POD, embeds it asynchronously, and makes it available for semantic and conversational querying.

            ## **Successful Response (200 OK)**

            This API follows an **asynchronous ingestion model**.

            On success, the API **confirms acceptance of the content**, but **does not guarantee immediate availability** for retrieval or querying.

            ### **What the response means**

            A `200 OK` response indicates that:

            * The request payload is valid
            * The content has been **accepted and queued** for processing
            * The content has been published to the internal event pipeline (RabbitMQ)
            * Embedding and storage will occur asynchronously

            ⚠️ **Important:**
            The newly posted content **will not appear immediately** in query or feed APIs.

            ---

            ## **Response Body (Example)**

            ```json
            {
              "status": "success",
              "message": "Content accepted for processing"
            }
            ```

            > No content data is returned in this response.

            ---

            ## **Availability & Retrieval Model**

            After receiving a successful response:

            1. The content is processed asynchronously
            2. The content becomes available in the floor feed **after processing completes**
            3. Developers must retrieve the content using:

            ```
            GET /api/memory/recent/events
            ```

            ---

            ## **Polling Requirement**

            Because ingestion is asynchronous:

            * Developers **must poll** `/api/memory/recent/events`
            * Polling should be done using:

              * `floor_id`
              * timestamp or last-known event marker
            * Compare previously retrieved events with new responses to detect newly added content

            This design ensures:

            * High ingestion throughput
            * Non-blocking uploads
            * Reliable embedding and storage pipelines

            ---

            ## **Typical Developer Flow**

            ```text
            POST /api/memory/events
                    ↓
            200 OK (content queued)
                    ↓
            Poll /api/memory/recent/events
                    ↓
            Detect new event
                    ↓
            Use content in /agent/memory/query
            ```

            ---

            ## **Key Design Note (Why This Exists)**

            This API is intentionally asynchronous to:

            * Support large files and multi-modal uploads
            * Avoid request timeouts during embedding
            * Enable scalable background processing
            * Keep write latency low

        ### Conversation Model

        - A **Thread** represents a single conversational context.
        - A **Conversation** is the ordered exchange of messages within a thread.
        - Threads are scoped per user and per floor.

        This API retrieves the list of **conversational threads** associated with a specific **user** within a specific **floor**.

        A **thread** represents a persistent conversation context between the user and the system (agent/assistant) inside a floor. Each thread maintains its own history and state, allowing users to resume previous conversations without losing context.

        The API returns **only thread metadata**, not the message content itself. This makes it suitable for:

        * Displaying a conversation list or sidebar
        * Allowing users to select and resume past conversations
        * Managing conversational memory per floor

        ---

        ## Key Concepts

        * **Thread**: A long-lived conversational context tied to a user and a floor
        * **Floor-scoped memory**: Conversations are isolated per floor; threads from one floor are not visible in another
        * **User-specific**: Threads are private to the requesting user

        ---

        ## Request Method

        `GET`

        ---

        ## Request Parameters (Query Parameters)

        | Parameter Name | Type   | Required | Description                                                                  |
        | -------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | `user_id`      | String | **Yes**  | Unique identifier of the user whose conversation threads are being requested |
        | `floor_id`     | String | **Yes**  | Identifier of the floor in which the conversations exist                     |

        ---

        ## Authorization & Access Rules

        * The caller must be authenticated as the given `user_id`
        * A user can retrieve **only their own threads**
        * Threads are scoped to the provided `floor_id`
        * Threads from other floors or other users are not accessible

        ---

        ## Response Format

        `application/json`

        ---

        ## Response Description

        The response contains:

        * The `user_id` for which threads were fetched
        * A list of thread metadata objects, sorted by **most recently updated first**

            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        ---

        ## Typical Use Cases

        * Show a **list of past conversations** in a chat UI
        * Allow users to **resume a previous thread**
        * Display conversation history grouped by floor
        * Build agent dashboards with user-specific memory

        ---

        ## Notes

        * This API returns **metadata only**; message history is retrieved using a separate thread-messages API
        * If no threads exist, the `threads` array will be empty
        * Thread titles may be system-generated or user-editable depending on implementation

        This API retrieves the **latest posts (events)** from a specified floor.

        The behaviour of the API changes based on whether a **user ID** is provided:

        * **If `user_id` is provided**
          → The API returns **recent posts relevant to that user**, scoped within the given floor.
          This includes posts from:

          * Floors the user follows
          * Floors created by the user
          * Pod floors associated with the user (if applicable)

        * **If `user_id` is NOT provided**
          → The API returns the **most recent posts available in the specified floor**, without user-specific filtering.

        This makes the API suitable for:

        * Personalized activity feeds
        * Floor-level public timelines
        * Pod-based content aggregation
        * Developer-built pods and custom clients

        ---

        ## **Key Concepts**

        * A **floor** represents a content space (independent floor, followed floor, or pod floor)
        * A **pod floor** may aggregate content across multiple related floors
        * Posts are returned **in reverse chronological order** (latest first)
        * Each post belongs to a specific **block** within the floor

        This API returns the **full conversation history** for a specific **thread** belonging to a user within a floor.

        A **thread** represents a persistent conversation session. Each item in the returned `conversation` array contains:

        * The **user request payload** (user query + context)
        * The **assistant response payload** (full LLM completion object)
        * The **retrieval trace** (metadata of posts fetched/used for the answer, including scores and identifiers)

        This endpoint is intended for **developers** building custom conversational UIs and tooling that require:

        * Full conversation replay
        * Debug visibility into the assistant output object (`choices`, model info, etc.)
        * RAG explainability via `fetch_multiple_posts.results[]`

        | ----------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | `user_id`   | String | **Yes**  | Owner of the conversation thread. The thread must belong to this user.      |
        | `floor_id`  | String | **Yes**  | Floor identifier in which the thread exists. Threads are scoped to a floor. |
        | `thread_id` | String | **Yes**  | Thread identifier whose conversations should be returned.                   |

        ---

        ## Authorization & Access Rules

        * The caller must be authenticated as the given `user_id` (or have equivalent developer/system permission).
        * A user can access **only their own threads**.
        * Cross-user or cross-floor access must be rejected.

        ---

        ## Response Format

        `application/json`

        ---

        ## Response Description

        Returns the thread-level conversation payload:

        Your provided payload is the canonical example. It includes:

        * the user query and floor context
        * the full assistant completion object
        * the full retrieval results with post metadata
        * the response shown covers a few important items.

        ---

        ## Common Error Responses

        ### Missing Parameters

        ```json
        {
          "status": "ERROR",
          "message": "user_id, floor_id, and thread_id are required"
        }
        ```

        ### Unauthorized Access

        ```json
        {
          "status": "ERROR",
          "message": "Unauthorized access to thread"
        }
        ```

        ### Thread Not Found

        ```json
        {
          "status": "ERROR",
          "message": "Thread not found"
        }
        ```

        ---

        ## Developer Notes (Important)

        * The `content` field inside retrieval results is a **stringified JSON**. Developers may parse it to access fields such as `post_title`, `post_details`, etc.
        * `choices` may contain multiple outputs depending on backend configuration.
        * This API returns a “full debug payload” suitable for developers. If you later create a lightweight UI endpoint, it should strip execution details and return only `user_query`, `assistant.content`, and curated post references.

                          You are an AI assistant operating inside a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

                          Your primary responsibility is to provide accurate, context-aware responses while minimizing unnecessary retrieval.

                          Before responding, internally determine the nature of the user query:

                          1. If the query is conversational, social, or generic (e.g., greetings, small talk, acknowledgements),
                             respond naturally WITHOUT relying on retrieved context.

                          2. If the query requires factual, historical, analytical, or domain-specific information,
                             rely STRICTLY on the provided context. Do not hallucinate beyond it.

                          3. If the query is a follow-up, assume it refers to the immediately preceding context unless explicitly stated otherwise.

                          When context is provided:
                          - Treat it as authoritative.
                          - Synthesize, summarize, or analyze it as requested.
                          - If the context is insufficient, clearly state that limitation.

                          Follow-up questions:
                          - Ask follow-up questions ONLY when they help the user explore or refine the provided context.
                          - Ensure each follow-up is directly grounded in the retrieved information.
                          - Avoid generic or open-ended prompts such as “Would you like to know more?”

                          Tone & Style:
                          - Be concise, precise, and helpful.
                          - Prefer structured answers (bullets, steps, short sections) when clarity improves.
                          - Avoid speculation and filler language.

                          When retrieved content is provided, assume it represents the relevant discussion history or knowledge base for the query.

                          Your task is NOT to list or describe the retrieved items.
                          Your task IS to synthesize them into a direct answer to the user’s question.

                          Only reference individual posts explicitly if attribution improves clarity.
                          Otherwise, merge ideas into a coherent response.

                          Never include meta labels such as:
                          - "User's question"
                          - "Matched content"
                          - "Retrieved content"
                          - "Context"

                          Do not explain what was retrieved.
                          Do not describe the retrieval process.
                          Only provide the final synthesized answer unless explicitly asked for sources.

                          You are not required to use retrieval for every response.
                          Your goal is relevance, not verbosity.

                          Conversation Modes Policy:

                          Before generating a response, internally classify the user message into ONE of the following modes:

                          1. KNOWLEDGE MODE
                             - Queries asking for facts, explanations, summaries, comparisons, or domain information.
                             - Use retrieved context when relevant.
                             - Synthesize content into a direct answer.
                             - Do not describe the retrieval process.

                          2. META MODE
                             - Queries asking for feedback, evaluation, opinions, or reflection about:
                               a) the conversation
                               b) the user’s questions
                               c) system behavior or reasoning
                             - Do NOT summarize prior discussion unless explicitly requested.
                             - Focus on analysis, clarity, depth, intent, and direction.
                             - Avoid encouragement, praise, or conversational fillers.
                             - Be concise, specific, and critical where appropriate.

                          3. SOCIAL MODE
                             - Personal opinions, casual questions, or subjective judgments.
                             - Answer directly and briefly.
                             - Do NOT infer facts about the user beyond what is explicitly stated.
                             - Do NOT invent supporting examples or narratives.
                             - Do NOT ask follow-up questions unless the user explicitly invites them.
                             - Prefer a single-sentence response when possible.

                          Always respond strictly according to the identified mode.
                          Do not mix modes in a single response.

                          SELF-REFERENCE POLICY:

                          When the user asks why you said something, why you mentioned or omitted something,
                          or questions your intent, bias, or behavior:

                          - Do NOT provide new information.
                          - Do NOT promote, recommend, or defend entities.
                          - Explain your reasoning strictly based on the prior conversation.
                          - If something was mentioned due to limited context, say so plainly.
                          - If the omission was unintentional, acknowledge it directly.
                          - Keep the response short and neutral.

        It is used to fetch all essential metadata required to **render a floor landing page, header, or navigation context**.

        The response includes:

        * Floor identity and type
        * Ownership information relative to the requesting user
        * Floor metadata (title, description, avatar)
        * List of blocks available in the floor
        * App association (for pod / developer use cases)

        This API does **not** return posts or content; it only provides **structural and descriptive information** about the floor.

        ---

        ## Typical Use Cases

        * Render floor header (title, logo, description)
        * Decide UI permissions (owner vs non-owner)
        * Display available blocks (Feeds, Blog, Quiz, etc.)
        * Pod discovery or developer-managed floor rendering
        * Lightweight floor metadata fetch before loading content

        ---

        ## Authorization & Context

        * The API may be called by authenticated or unauthenticated users (depending on floor visibility).
        * The `is_owner` field is calculated **relative to the requesting user context** (if authenticated).

        ---

        ## Response Format

        `application/json`

        ## Response Structure

        ### Top-Level Fields

        | Field        | Type                   | Description                                                      |
        | ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | `floor_id`   | String                 | Public, human-readable identifier of the floor                   |
        | `floor_uid`  | String                 | Internal unique identifier of the floor                          |
        | `title`      | String                 | Display title of the floor                                       |
        | `details`    | String                 | Short description or summary of the floor                        |
        | `floor_type` | String                 | Type of floor (`PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE`, `POD`)                       |
        | `is_owner`   | String (`"0"` / `"1"`) | Indicates whether the requesting user is the owner               |
        | `blocks`     | Array                  | List of blocks available in the floor                            |
        | `avatar`     | Object                 | Floor logo / avatar metadata                                     |
        | `app_id`     | String                 | Associated application ID (used mainly for pod/developer floors) |

        ---

        ## Ownership Indicator

        ### `is_owner`

        ```json
        "is_owner": "0"
        ```

        | Value | Meaning                                   |
        | ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
        | `"1"` | Requesting user is the owner of the floor |
        | `"0"` | Requesting user is not the owner          |

        This field is typically used by clients to:

        * Enable or disable edit/settings UI
        * Show owner-only actions

        ---

        ## Blocks Object

        ```json
        "blocks": [
          {
            "block_id": "1765960948723",
            "type": "1",
            "title": "Feeds"
          }
        ]
        ```

        Each block represents a **content category or service** available inside the floor.

        ### Block Fields

        | Field   | Type   | Description                                           |
        | ------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |

        ```json
        "avatar": {
          "id": "1767009204367",
          "url": "https://..."
        }
        ```

        | Field | Type   | Description                    |
        | ----- | ------ | ------------------------------ |
        | `id`  | String | Media identifier of the avatar |
        | `url` | String | CDN URL of the floor logo      |

        Used to render the floor’s profile image or banner.

        ---

        ## Floor Type

        ```json
        "floor_type": "POD"
        ```

        | Value     | Meaning                               |
        | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
        | `PUBLIC`  | Open floor visible to everyone        |
        | `PRIVATE` | Restricted floor                      |
        | `POD`     | Aggregated or developer-managed floor |

        `POD` floors are often associated with an `app_id` and may aggregate or serve content programmatically.

        ---

        ## Sample Success Response

        ```json
        {
          "is_owner": "0",
          "blocks": [
            {
              "block_id": "1765960948723",
              "type": "1",
              "title": "Feeds"
            }
          ],
          "floor_uid": "1765960956967",
          "floor_id": "raghupodfloor1",
          "details": "raghu",
          "avatar": {
            "id": "1767009204367",
            "url": "https://d2e5822u5ecuq8.cloudfront.net/room/1765960956967/logo/1765960956967.jpg"
          },
          "title": "raghu",
          "floor_type": "POD",
          "app_id": "1765949734005"
        }
        ```

        ## Notes for Developers

        * This is a **lightweight metadata API** and is safe to call frequently.
        * Use this API **before** loading posts or analytics.
        * `blocks` ordering can be used directly for navigation UI.
        * `floor_type` + `is_owner` together determine which UI actions are allowed.

        ## Common Error Scenarios

        ### Floor Not Found

        ```json
        {
          "status": "ERROR",
          "message": "Floor not found"
        }
        ```

        ### Access Restricted

        ```json
        {
          "status": "ERROR",
          "message": "Access denied for this floor"
        }
        ```

        This API updates an existing floor’s profile metadata using **multipart form data**.

        A floor **can be edited only by its owner**.
        If the authenticated user is **not the owner of the floor**, the request will be rejected, even if the user is a member or follower of the floor.

        The API allows the floor owner to update:

        * Floor **title**
        * Floor **details/description**
        * Floor **logo/avatar image**

        After a successful update, the API returns the **latest floor object**, including the updated avatar and the current list of blocks associated with the floor.

        ---

        ## Authorization Rules (Critical)

        * The caller **must be authenticated**
        * The caller **must be the owner of the floor**
        * Members, followers, or pod consumers **cannot** edit the floor
        * Ownership is validated internally using the authenticated user context

        > **Ownership is mandatory. There are no partial permissions for this API.**

        ---

        ## Content-Type

        `multipart/form-data`

        ---

        ## Request Body (Multipart Form Data)

        ### Form Fields

        | Field Name | Type   | Required     | Description                              |
        | ---------- | ------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
        | `fid`      | String | Recommended* | Immutable internal floor ID              |
        | `floor_id` | String | Optional*    | Public / human-readable floor identifier |
        | `title`    | String | Optional     | New floor title                          |
        | `details`  | String | Optional     | New floor description                    |
        | `logo`     | File   | Optional     | New floor logo image (PNG/JPG/WebP)      |

        * At least **one floor identifier** (`fid` or `floor_id`) must be provided.
        **Best practice:** Use `fid` as the primary identifier.

        ---

        ## Update Rules

        * At least one of `title`, `details`, or `logo` must be present
        * Missing update fields result in a validation error
        * If `logo` is provided, the previous logo is replaced

        ---

        ## Response Format

        ```

        ---

        ## Notes

        * This API is **owner-only by design**
        * Pods and developer tools must operate using **owner credentials**
        * Blocks are returned for convenience but are **not editable through this API**

    post:

      description: |
        This API changes a floor’s visibility to **PRIVATE**.

        It is used when a floor owner wants to **restrict access** to a floor that is currently public. After the update, the floor becomes private and is no longer accessible to non-authorized users (based on your platform’s access rules).

        This endpoint is **state-changing**:

        * If the floor is **PUBLIC**, it will be converted to **PRIVATE**
        * If the floor is already **PRIVATE**, the API returns success (idempotent) or an “already private” response depending on implementation

        This API is commonly used in:

        * Floor settings → “Privacy” toggle
        * Developer-managed pod workflows (app_id context)
        * Admin tools (if applicable)

        ---

        ## Request Method

        `POST`

        ---

        ## Content-Type

        `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (or `multipart/form-data` if your system uses form-data)
        *(Document whichever you actually accept; below assumes standard form fields.)*

        ---

        ## Request Parameters (Form Fields)

        | Field      | Type   | Required | Description                                                          |
        | ---------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | `user_id`  | String | **Yes**  | User requesting the change. Must be the **owner** of the floor.      |
        | `floor_id` | String | **Yes**  | Public identifier of the floor to update.                            |
        | `app_id`   | String | No       | Calling application identifier (used for developer/pod integration). |

        ---

        ## Authorization Rules (Critical)

        * The caller must be authenticated as `user_id`
        * **Only the floor owner** can change floor visibility
        * If the user is not the owner, the request must be rejected

        ---

        ## Behavior Rules

        * Converts visibility from **PUBLIC → PRIVATE**
        * Does not modify floor content or blocks
        * Access enforcement for private floors is applied immediately after the change

        **Idempotency**

        * Calling this API multiple times should not cause repeated changes
        * If already private, the API should either:

          * return success with a message like `"already private"`, or
          * return a specific error/status indicating no-op

        ---

        ## Response Format

        `application/json`

        ---

        ## Sample Success Response

        *(Example — adjust to match your actual response format)*

        ```json
        {
          "status": "SUCCESS",
          "floor_id": "my_floor",
          "visibility": "PRIVATE",
          "message": "Floor is now private"
        }
        ```

        ---

        ## Sample No-Op Response (Already Private)

        ```json
        {
          "status": "SUCCESS",
          "floor_id": "my_floor",
          "visibility": "PRIVATE",
          "message": "Floor is already private"
        }
        ```

        ---

        ## Error Responses (Examples)

        ### Not Authorized (Not Owner)

        ```json
        {
          "status": "ERROR",
          "message": "Only the floor owner can change floor visibility"
        }
        ```

        ### Floor Not Found

        ```json
        {
          "status": "ERROR",
          "message": "Floor not found"
        }
        ```

        ### Invalid Request

        ```json
        {
          "status": "ERROR",
          "message": "user_id and floor_id are required"
        }
        ```

        ---

        ## Notes

        * This API is intended to control floor visibility only; membership/invite rules (for private floors) are handled elsewhere.
        * `app_id` is provided for developer/pod applications and is optional unless enforced by your app model.
        * If you support floor types like `POD`, document whether pods are allowed to be private or not (some platforms restrict this).

        This API changes a floor’s visibility to **PUBLIC**.

        It is used when a floor owner wants to **make a private floor accessible to everyone**. After the update, the floor becomes public and can be viewed and discovered by any user, subject to platform rules (search, feeds, pods, etc.).

        This endpoint performs a **visibility state transition**:

        * **PRIVATE → PUBLIC**
        * If the floor is already public, the operation is treated as **idempotent** (no state change).

        This API is typically used from:

        * Floor settings → Privacy / Visibility controls
        * Owner or admin tools
        * Developer or pod-based applications using `app_id`

        ---

        ## Request Method

        `POST`

        ---

        ## Content-Type

        `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
        (or `multipart/form-data`, depending on your implementation)

        ---

        ## Request Parameters (Form Fields)

        | Field      | Type   | Required | Description                                                                     |
        | ---------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | `user_id`  | String | **Yes**  | User requesting the change. Must be the **owner** of the floor.                 |
        | `floor_id` | String | **Yes**  | Public identifier of the floor whose visibility is to be changed.               |
        | `app_id`   | String | No       | Identifier of the calling application (used mainly for pod/developer contexts). |

        ---

        ## Authorization Rules (Critical)

        * The caller must be authenticated as `user_id`
        * **Only the floor owner** is allowed to change the floor’s visibility
        * Requests from non-owners must be rejected

        ---

        ## Behavior Rules

        * Converts floor visibility from **PRIVATE → PUBLIC**
        * Does not modify floor content, blocks, or ownership
        * Visibility change takes effect immediately

        ### Idempotency

        * If the floor is already public, the API should:

          * Return success with a message indicating no change, or
          * Return a specific “already public” status (implementation-dependent)

        ---

        ## Response Format

        `application/json`

        ---

        ## Sample Success Response

        ```json
        {
          "status": "SUCCESS",
          "floor_id": "my_floor",
          "visibility": "PUBLIC",
          "message": "Floor is now public"
        }
        ```

        ---

        ## Sample No-Op Response (Already Public)

        ```json
        {
          "status": "SUCCESS",
          "floor_id": "my_floor",
          "visibility": "PUBLIC",
          "message": "Floor is already public"
        }
        ```

        ---

        ## Error Responses (Examples)

        ### Not Authorized (Not Owner)

        ```json
        {
          "status": "ERROR",
          "message": "Only the floor owner can change floor visibility"
        }
        ```

        ---

        ### Floor Not Found

        ```json
        {
          "status": "ERROR",
          "message": "Floor not found"
        }
        ```

        ---

        ### Invalid Request

        ```json
        {
          "status": "ERROR",
          "message": "user_id and floor_id are required"
        }
        ```

        ---

        ## Notes for Developers

        * This API controls **visibility only**. Membership, invitations, and moderation rules are handled by separate APIs.
        * `app_id` is optional and primarily used for developer-managed or pod floors.
        * Clients should refresh floor metadata (e.g., via `/api/floor/info`) after a successful visibility change.

        This API renames a floor by changing knowing the **floor identifier (floor_id)**.

        It allows the **floor owner** to update the public-facing floor ID (slug/handle) from an old value to a new value. This is typically used when the owner wants to rebrand, reorganize, or correct the floor’s identifier.

        ⚠️ **This operation affects how the floor is accessed and referenced externally**, so it must be performed carefully.

        ---

        ## Ownership & Authorization (Critical)

        * The caller **must be authenticated**
        * **Only the floor owner** is allowed to rename a floor
        * Members, followers, or non-owners **cannot** perform this operation
        * Ownership is validated internally using `user_id`

        > If the user is not the owner, the request must be rejected.

        | `user_id` | String | **Yes**  | User requesting the rename. Must be the **owner** of the floor.                 |

        | `app_id`  | String | No       | Identifier of the calling application (used mainly for pod/developer contexts). |

        ---

        ## Rename Rules & Constraints

        * The `from` floor ID **must exist**
        * The `to` floor ID **must be unique** and not already in use
        * The rename operation updates **only the floor ID**

          * Floor ownership, blocks, posts, and internal `fid` remain unchanged
        * Any links or references using the old floor ID may no longer be valid after rename

        ---

        ## Notes for Developers

        * This API **renames the public identifier only**; the internal immutable floor ID (`fid`) is not affected.
        * Clients should refresh cached floor metadata after a successful rename.
        * If your platform supports deep links or bookmarks, consider redirect or alias handling for old floor IDs (if supported).

        At least **one of `mobile_number` or `email_id` is required** to register a user. Both may be provided if available.

        The API registers the user under the specified application context and prepares the account for subsequent authentication and usage.

        Upon successful registration, the API returns:
        - a unique user_id identifying the newly created user, and
        - a success string indicating the outcome of the sign-up operation.
        The user account is created under the specified application context and can be used for subsequent interactions with Floor POD APIs.

        ## **Validate Activation / Verification Code**

        This API **validates a one-time verification code** submitted by a user and **executes the corresponding account operation** based on the specified **mode**.

        Depending on the mode, the API may:

        * Activate a newly registered account
        * Confirm a login attempt
        * Verify a password change or reset
        * Validate email or mobile updates
        * Confirm account deletion or clearing requests

        The API verifies the provided `activation_code` against the given `user_id`, `mode`, and application context.
        If validation succeeds, the requested operation is completed and the API returns the relevant **POD information** and **user profile details** (where applicable).

        If validation fails, the operation is **not performed** and an appropriate error response is returned.

        ---

        ## **Authentication**

        This endpoint requires **Bearer Token authentication**.

        **Header**

        ```
        Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
        ```

        ---

        ## **Request Body**

        ```json
        {
          "user_id": "string",
          "activation_code": "string",
          "app_id": "string",
          "mode": "string"
        }
        ```

        ### **Field Descriptions**

        * **user_id** – Unique identifier of the user initiating the operation
        * **activation_code** – One-time verification code sent to the user
        * **app_id** – Application identifier (optional or context-specific)
        * **mode** – Operation context for which the verification is being performed

        ---

        ## **Usage Scenarios (Mode Definitions)**

        | Mode | Purpose                                  |
        | ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
        | 0    | Email or mobile number change            |
        | 1    | Password change                          |
        | 2    | Delete account                           |
        | 3    | Clear account                            |
        | 4    | Signup verification (account activation) |
        | 5    | Login verification                       |
        | 6    | Forgot password verification             |

        ---

        ## **Successful Response**

        On successful validation:

        * The requested operation (based on `mode`) is completed
        * The API returns:

          * **POD information** associated with the user (if applicable)
          * **User profile details** (if applicable)

        Examples:

        * For **signup verification**, the user account is activated
        * For **login**, access is confirmed
        * For **password reset**, the user may proceed to set a new password
        * For **account deletion**, the request is confirmed

        ---

        ## **Error Response**

        The API returns an error response when:

        * The activation code is invalid or expired
        * The activation code does not match the user or operation mode
        * The requested operation is already completed (e.g., user already activated)
        * Authorization fails or the bearer token is missing or invalid

        ⚠️ In all error cases, **no account state change occurs**.

        ## 1) `POST /password/change` — Change Password (Logged-in User)

        Changes the password of an **authenticated user** who is currently logged in.

        This endpoint is used when a user is already signed in and wants to update their password as a security or preference action. The system validates a **one-time password-change verification code** (`activation_code`) issued specifically for the change-password flow. If the code is valid and not expired, the user’s password is updated to `new_password` and takes effect immediately.

        If verification fails, the password remains unchanged and an error response is returned.

        ### Authentication

        ✅ **Required**: Bearer token for the logged-in session

        ```
        Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
        ```

        ### Request Body (Form Data)

        * `user_id` (optional if derived from token)
        * `activation_code` (required)
        * `new_password` (required)

        ### Behavior Notes

        * Typically requires a prior call to **send a verification code** for password change (mode = password change).
        * `user_id` can be taken from the access token; include it only if your system requires it explicitly.

        ## Reset Password (Forgot Password, Not Logged In)

        Resets the password of a user who **cannot log in** and is using a **forgot-password** flow.

        This endpoint is used when the user is not authenticated and requests a password reset using a verified identity channel such as **email** or **mobile number**. The system validates a **one-time reset verification code** (`activation_code`) issued for the reset-password flow. If valid and not expired, the password is updated to `new_password` and takes effect immediately.

        If verification fails, the password remains unchanged and an error response is returned.

        ### Authentication

        ✅ **Recommended** (better security): a short-lived **reset token** issued after initiating reset

        ```
        Authorization: Bearer <reset_token>
        ```

        > If you don’t use a reset token, you must enforce strong rate limiting + OTP attempt throttling on this endpoint.

        ### Request Body (Form Data)

        * `email_id` or `mobile_number` (required to identify user)
        * `activation_code` (required)
        * `new_password` (required)
        * `user_id` (optional, if your reset flow already resolved it)

        ### Behavior Notes

        * Requires a prior call to **initiate reset** and send OTP/code (mode = forgot password).
        * Must enforce code attempt limits and expiration strictly.

        ### One-Line Summary

        > Resets a user’s password (forgot-password flow) after validating a one-time reset code sent to email or mobile.

        * The activation code is verified
        * The user’s email ID is updated immediately
        * A `success` string is returned confirming the email change

        ---

        ### **Error Response**

        The API returns an error response if:

        * The activation code is invalid or expired
        * The activation code does not match the user or email
        * The new email ID is already in use
        * Authorization fails or the bearer token is missing or invalid

        In all error cases, the existing email ID remains unchanged.

        ---
        ### **Behavior Notes**

        * Requires a prior call to `/auth-service/send/validation/code` with the proper mode.

        ---

        ### **Security Notes (Recommended)**

        * Activation codes are single-use and time-bound
        * Email changes require prior authentication
        * Rate limiting may be applied to prevent abuse

        Updates the mobile number associated with an existing user account after validating a one-time activation code sent to the **new mobile number**.

        This operation can only be performed by a **logged-in user**. When a user initiates a mobile number change, an activation code is sent to the newly provided mobile number. The mobile number update takes effect only after the activation code is successfully validated.

        If the activation code validation fails, the mobile number remains unchanged.

        ### **Authentication**

        This endpoint requires **Bearer Token authentication**.

        ```
        Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
        ```

        ---

        ### **Request Body**

        ```json
        {
          "user_id": "string",
          "new_mobile_number": "string",
          "activation_code": "string"
        }
        ```

        **Field Description**

        * `user_id` – Unique identifier of the logged-in user
        * `new_mobile_number` – New mobile number to be associated with the account
        * `activation_code` – One-time activation code sent to the new mobile number for verification

        ---

        ### **Flow Summary**

        1. User is authenticated and logged in
        2. User requests to change mobile number
        3. System sends an activation code to the **new mobile number**
        4. User submits the activation code via this API
        5. On successful validation, the mobile number is updated

        ---

        ### **Successful Response**

        On successful validation:

        * The activation code is verified
        * The user’s mobile number is updated immediately
        * A `success` string is returned confirming the mobile number change

        ---

        Generates and sends a one-time validation code to the user for verification of sensitive or critical account operations.

        This API is used across multiple authentication and account-management flows. The validation code is delivered to the user via the appropriate channel (**email or mobile number**), based on the requested operation mode and the input provided.

        The generated code is **time-bound**, **single-use**, and must be validated using the corresponding verification APIs to complete the requested action.

        ---

        ### **Usage Scenarios (Mode Definition)**

        | Mode | Purpose                       |
        | ---- | ----------------------------- |
        | `0`  | Email or mobile number change |
        | `1`  | Password change               |
        | `2`  | Delete account                |
        | `3`  | Clear account                 |
        | `4`  | Signup Verification           |
        | `5`  | Using OTP for Login           |
        | `6`  | OTP for forgot password       |

        **Mode `4` – Signup Verification**
        For login verification, the validation code is sent to **either the email ID or the mobile number provided in the request**.
        At least **one of email or mobile number must be supplied** for this mode.

        ---

        ### **Behavior**

        * Generates a secure, one-time validation code
        * Sends the code to the appropriate channel:

          * Email or mobile number, depending on the operation mode and input
        * Associates the code with:

          * User identity (or login identifier)
          * Requested operation (`mode`)
          * Application context (if applicable)
        * Validation codes are valid for a limited duration and **cannot be reused**

        ---

        ### **Authentication**

        This endpoint requires **Bearer Token authentication**,
        **except** where explicitly allowed (for example, login-related flows).

        ```
        Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
        ```

        ---

        ### **Successful Response**

        On success, the API confirms that the validation code has been generated and successfully dispatched to the user.

        ---

        ### **Error Response**

        The API returns an error response if:

        * The user does not exist or is not eligible for the requested operation
        * The requested mode is invalid or unsupported
        * Required identifiers (email or mobile number for login verification) are missing
        * Rate limits are exceeded
        * Authorization fails (where applicable)

        ---

        ### **Security Notes (Recommended)**

        * Validation codes are single-use and time-bound
        * Rate limiting is enforced to prevent abuse
        * Repeated failures may trigger temporary blocking or additional verification

        ---

        This API allows a calling application to **pass externally authenticated user identity information to xfloor** after completing authentication within its own system.

        xfloor **does not perform authentication, credential verification, or session management** as part of this API. The calling application is fully responsible for validating the user and ensuring the correctness of the identity data provided.

        Upon invocation, xfloor will:

        * **Create a new user profile** if no matching user exists, or
        * **Update the existing user profile** if the user is already present.

        xfloor returns a unique `xfloor_user_id`, which serves as the **canonical user identifier** and must be used in all subsequent xfloor APIs, including floors, blocks, conversations, memory interactions, and analytics.

      description: |+
        This API initiates the **sign-in validation process** by sending a **one-time validation code (OTP)** to the user.

        The OTP is delivered to **either the mobile number or the email address** provided in the request.
        This endpoint is typically called **before completing sign-in**, to verify that the user owns the supplied contact identifier.

        The calling application is responsible for:

        * Collecting the OTP from the user
        * Submitting it to the OTP verification API (handled separately)

        ---

        ## **Use Case**

        * User attempts to sign in
        * User provides **mobile number or email**
        * System sends a **validation code (OTP)**
        * User enters OTP to complete sign-in

        ---

        ## **Request Method**

        `POST`

        ---

        ## **Formdata Parameters**

        | Parameter Name  | Type   | Required  | Description                                 |
        | --------------- | ------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
        | `mobile_number` | String | Optional* | Mobile number to which the OTP will be sent |
        | `email_id`      | String | Optional* | Email address to which the OTP will be sent |
        | `app_id`        | String | Optional  | Identifier of the calling application       |

        * **Either `mobile_number` or `email_id` must be provided.**
        Providing both is allowed; the system may choose one based on configuration.

        ---

        ## **Request Rules**

        * At least **one** of `mobile_number` or `email_id` is mandatory
        * If both are missing, the request will be rejected
        * OTP delivery channel depends on the provided identifier

        ---

        ## **Response Format**

        `application/json`

        ---

        ## **Sample Success Response**

        ```json
        {
          "status": "SUCCESS",
          "message": "Validation code sent successfully"
        }
        ```

        ---

        ## **Sample Error Responses**

        ### Missing Identifier

        ```json
        {
          "status": "ERROR",
          "message": "Either mobile_number or email_id must be provided"
        }
        ```

        ### Invalid Identifier

        ```json
        {
          "status": "ERROR",
          "message": "Invalid mobile number or email address"
        }
        ```

        ---

        ## **Notes**

        * This API **only sends** the validation code
        * OTP verification must be performed using the corresponding **verify validation code** API
        * Rate limiting and retry restrictions may apply to prevent abuse
