FloorMemory SDKs provide a **typed, language-native interface** to the FloorMemory APIs.

They are designed to:
- simplify authentication handling
- enforce request/response schemas
- reduce boilerplate HTTP code
- remain thin wrappers over the APIs

SDKs do not introduce custom behavior or hide API semantics.
